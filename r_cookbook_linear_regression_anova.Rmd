The lm function can perform linear regression. The main argument is a model formula, such as y ~ x. The formula has the response variable on the left of the tilde character (~) and the predictor variable on the right. The function estimates the regression coefficients, β0 and β1, and reports them as the intercept and the coefficient of x, respectively.

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```
```{r}
lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$hp)
```
```{r}
lm(mpg ~ hp, data=mtcars)
```
Where the equation of the line is yi = 30.09886 - 0.06823xi + εi
